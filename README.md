this code will find a best way between location of car and one of hospitals.
at first you input all data like num of hospital and locations.
then you input num of node and edge.
and at the end you input cost of edges(between two node).(cost>=0)
if cost = 0 then we don't have any edge between that nodes.
(UISING DIJKSTRA ALGORITHM).
